# AI Work Trace

## Request

- Date: 2026-07-05
- User request: Apply the review findings about reducing unnecessary reasoning
  in high-end LLM coding services, including development process and adoption.
- Current phase: Architecture Path / process implementation.

## Context Ledger

- Included: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`,
  `docs/architecture/agent-quickstart.md`,
  `docs/architecture/ai-request-routing.md`,
  `docs/collaboration/model-tool-capability-matrix.md`,
  `docs/collaboration/privacy-context-budget-policy.md`, README, rollout
  spec, scripts, CI, trace policy.
- Omitted: target-project implementation, target stack choices, provider
  choices, datastore choices, private data, external documentation.
- Assumptions: reducing mandatory full reasoning is acceptable when safety
  gates still force full process for feature and architecture work.
- Open decisions: target projects may tune Fast Path thresholds after adoption.

## Routing

- Model/assistant/tool: Codex for contract and script edits; deterministic
  shell checks for validation.
- Reason: this changes collaboration rules and onboarding behavior.
- Privacy constraints: no private or external data used.

## Referee Decisions

- User requested applying the review findings.

## Verification

- Commands/checks:
  - `bash -n scripts/copy-ai-collaboration-files.sh`
  - `bash -n scripts/init-llm-context.sh`
  - copy into a temporary repository with an existing README.
  - confirm `docs/collaboration/adoption-guide.md` is copied.
  - confirm the generated LLM prompt mentions Fast Path, Feature Path,
    Architecture Path, and compact design notes.
  - repository sanity check equivalent to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
  - `rg` check for `voice-to-dic` residue.
- Result: passed.

## Changed Files

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `README.md`
- `docs/architecture/agent-quickstart.md`
- `docs/architecture/ai-request-routing.md`
- `docs/architecture/implementation-readiness.md`
- `docs/collaboration/adoption-guide.md`
- `docs/collaboration/model-tool-capability-matrix.md`
- `docs/collaboration/privacy-context-budget-policy.md`
- `docs/collaboration/traces/2026-07-05-reasoning-efficiency.md`
- `docs/at-tdd/process.md`
- `docs/specs/template-rollout.md`
- `docs/templates/phase-request.md`
- `scripts/init-llm-context.sh`

## Next Safe Action

- Run deterministic verification and refine wording if checks expose drift.

## Notes

- Expected behavior change: agents should choose the smallest safe operating
  path and avoid full reasoning scaffolds for mechanical local work.
